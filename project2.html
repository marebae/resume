            <p>
                This project involved developing a website for the Society of Hispanic
                Professional Engineers (SHPE) at the University of Central Florida.
                The website provides information about organization events, leadership,
                and member resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application was built using React with TypeScript (TSX) for the
                front-end and MongoDB for managing application data.
            </p>
